### Is there any message before the license expires, and how to renew the license after it expires?

The system will send expiration notifications before the license expires.

The notification time before the license expires is different for the full version license and the trial version license.

- For the full version license:

  - Within 30 days before the license expires or on the day the license expires, there is an expiration reminder when NebulaGraph/Dashboard/Explorer is started.

  - There is a 14-day buffer period after expiration. During the buffer period, you will receive expiration notifications and can continue using NebulaGraph/Dashboard/Explorer. After the buffer period ends, the corresponding service will be down and cannot be started. 

- For the trial version license: 

  - Within 7 days before the license expires or on the day the license expires, there is an expiration reminder when NebulaGraph/Dashboard/Explorer is started.

  - There is no buffer period after expiration. Once the license expires, the corresponding service will be down and cannot be started.
